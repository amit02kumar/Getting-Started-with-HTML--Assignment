HTML Comments are the non-rendering text that provide the information to the programmer or human readers. 
HTML Comments are only used for the documentation purpose so that if a new programmer or user read it, it can understand easily by the programmer or the user.
These are helpful in making notes, or disabling some part of code without deleting it from the code.
Comments are ignored by the Browser and does't affect the rendring of the webpage.
